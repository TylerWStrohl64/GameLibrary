# GameLibrary
A Java Program to view &amp; manage a library of Video Games.

The program will allow users to track owned Video Games as well as add, manage, and search their library. 
My goal for this project is to further improve my Java skills & to learn about Java's Abstract Window Toolkit [AWT] & Swing.
I would also like to incorporate SQL into the program via JDBC.

The first rendition of this program will be Text-Based; using Java Eclipse IDE's Console.
